# Algorithm - Sorting

## Bubble Sort
- Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order
```shell
- Worst and Average Case Time Complexity: O(n*n). Worst case occurs when array is reverse sorted.
- Best Case Time Complexity: O(n). Best case occurs when array is already sorted.
- Auxiliary Space: O(1)
- Boundary Cases: Bubble sort takes minimum time (Order of n) when elements are already sorted.
- Sorting In Place: Yes
- Stable: Yes
```
